    // What is setTimeout()?
    // setTimeout sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code
    // once the timer expires.
    // Whenever setTimeout() is encountered in a Js code, Js engine offloads that code to browser.
    // Now, it’s browser’s responsibility to keep track of counter and remind Js engine that this code should be executed next.

    console.log(1);
    console.log(2);
    // test();
    console.log(3);
    console.log(4);
    function test() {
      // console.log("Hey, I am here");
      document.body.append("hello, I am here");
    }
    // test();

    // first arguments will be function and second argument will be the time.
    // saying hey, after 3 seconds
    setTimeout(test, 3000);

    // setInterval
    // setInterval() method repeatedly calls a function or
    // executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call.

    var id = setInterval(test, 5000);
    clearInterval(id);

    // But how does Js engine keeps track of what to execute next?
    // Enter Stack and Queue

    // When you call a function in JavaScript all the instructions within that function get loaded into a Stack.

    // Javascript then executes the instructions in each function by popping them from the stack.

<!-- Synchronous Execution
1. One Line at a time
2. Javascript executes code line by line. Almost every programming language execute 
code line by line.
-->

<!-- Asynchronous Execution
1. Multiple resource Multiple execution at a time.
2. JS is single threaded, so it cannot do multiple things at a time.
3. JS can act as asynchronous with the help of friend.
//Enter Browser API.
4. Whenever js engine encounters a piece of code that will take long time to 
execute it hand's over its execution to browser. Browser now takes care of that
task and when it finished, it pings the js engine that the task is done.
5. that's how js engine and browser work together to make javascript capabale of
asynchronous programming.

6. setTimeOut =>setTimeout sets a timer which executes a function 
or specified piece of code once the timer expires.
7. Whenever setTimeout() is encountered in a Js code, Js engine offloads 
that code to browser. 
8. Now, it’s browser’s responsibility to keep track of counter and remind Js 
engine that this code should be executed next.
(function(){
 setTimeout(()=> console.log(1),2000);
 console.log(2);
 setTimeout(()=> console.log(3),0);
 console.log(4);
})();

First the 2 is printed with the console.log, then even with a time delay of 0ms, the 4 is
printed before the 3 because JS executes setTimeout with the Web API, and so the entire function 
is executed first. Lastly, after a delay of 2000ms, the 1 is printed.
