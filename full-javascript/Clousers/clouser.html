    // A clouser gives you access to an outer function's scope
    // from an inner function. In Javascript, clousers are created every time a
    // function is created, at function creation time.

    // javascript functions
    // whenever javascript sees a .js file it creates a global execution contexts
    // whenever javascript sees a functions it creates a function execution contexts
    // clouser is related to functions
    // for each new functions there would be new execution contexts
    // what that functions executions context holds whatever the data inside that funtions holds
    // what happend when this greeting() functions will execute, will that executions contexts
    // stays there? when the function is executed the functions executions context is destroyed.
    // function can return anything
    // first function
    // function greeting() {
    //   let n = "raj";
    //   return n;
    // }
    // console.log(greeting());

    // second funtion
    // clouser is related to functions
    // nested functions
    // there has to be a dependency
    // greeting1 is parent function and returning child functions
    // and there is depencency between parent and child function,
    // that dependency is n1 and parents functions knows that
    // a child functions needs a variable that might destroyed when
    // its called, so what parents functions do it closes or freezed a
    // variable that is dependent or doesnt allow them to destroy but only
    // when there is dependency, clouser will make sure we are able to
    // excess that.
    // function greeting1() {
    //   let n1 = "sujata";  //n is going to garbage
    //   return function () {
    //     console.log(n1);
    //   };
    // }
    // let x = greeting1();
    // x();

    // third functions

    function greeting1() {
      let n1 = "sujata"; //n is going to garbage
      return function () {
        return function () {
          console.log(n1);

      };
