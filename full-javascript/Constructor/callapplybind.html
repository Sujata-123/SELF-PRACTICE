    // All JavaScript functions has access to some very special methods which we
    // can use to control where ‘this’ should refer.
    // Such methods are call(), bind() & apply().

    // Call() takes individual arguments separated by comma.

    // the difference between call and apply is that in case of call
    //we pass values by comma reperated but in case of apply we pass array, means
    //comma seperated arrays.

    // by seeing both functions we are having greet function which is common
    // in both function
    // suppose we have 10 constructor functions and we need same functionality
    // so if we will same greet function again and again that is not good
    // this because code duplication is not good.
    // so see below what we are going to do, we will put out that function..

    // function Student(firstName, lastName, subject) {
    //   this.firstName = firstName;
    //   this.lastName = lastName;
    //   this.subject = subject;

    //   this.greet = function () {
    //     console.log(`${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
    //   };
    // }

    // let student = new Student("John", "Joe", "CS");
    // student.greet();

    // function Employee(firstName, lastName, department) {
    //   this.firstName = firstName;
    //   this.lastName = lastName;
    //   this.department = department;

    //   this.greet = function () {
    //     console.log(`${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
    //   };
    // }

    // let employee = new Employee("Jason", "Smith");

    const greet = function (prefix,sufix) {
      // passing parameter
      console.log(`${prefix} ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} ${sufix}`);
    };

    // greet();
    function Student(firstName, lastName, subject) {
      this.firstName = firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
      this.subject = subject;
    }

    let student = new Student("John", "Joe", "CS");
    //first parament is this value that is student and next is which we passed inside fun.
    // we can pass comma seperated values as many as we want.
    greet.call(student,"hii","How are you?"); // here we are telling javascript that call greet
    // function for us but don't set this
    //whatever value we will pass, point that value to this.

    greet.apply(student,["hii","How are you?"])
    function Employee(firstName, lastName, department) {
      this.firstName = firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
      this.department = department;
    }

    let employee = new Employee("Jason", "Smith");

    greet.call(employee,"Mr","How are you");



    //bind kya karta hai wo new function deta hai or usko hum kabhi bhi use kar 
    //sakte hai

    let fn=greet.bind(student);
    fn("A","B");
